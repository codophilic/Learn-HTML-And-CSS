# About HTML
- **HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language**.
- It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet.
- It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).
- HTML is required because it forms the structure of web pages. Just like how a building needs a blueprint to be constructed, web pages need HTML to be displayed correctly on the internet.

## Why HTML is used in every browser?
- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a standard language that all web browsers understand and use to structure and display content on web pages.
- HTML is universally supported by all web browsers, making it the go-to language for web content.
- HTML is a set of markup symbols or codes that tell browsers how to display text, images, and other multimedia.
- It's the foundation for all the content and design elements on a web page, including headings, paragraphs, and links.
- **Standardizes web pages**: Ensures that web pages look consistent across different browsers, which improves the user experience.
- **Simplifies development**: Makes it easier to develop web pages.
- **Guarantees accessibility**: Ensures that web pages are accessible to all users, regardless of their preferred browser.

## Is HTML a programming language or a scripting language?
- HTML is neither a programming language nor a scripting language. Instead, it is a markup language. Here’s what that means:
  - **1. Markup Language**: HTML uses **tags** to mark up the content of a document, indicating what each part of the document is (headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.). It describes the structure and layout of a web page without containing any logic or behavior.
  - **2. No Logic or Algorithms**: Unlike programming languages (like Python, Java, C++), HTML doesn’t perform calculations, control flow (like loops and conditionals), or handle user interactions. It simply defines the structure and content of the web page.
  - **3. No Scripting**: Scripting languages (like JavaScript) are used to create dynamic and interactive web content. While HTML structures the content, scripting languages add behavior and interactivity.

## Purpose of HTML 
- The main purpose of HTML is to structure content on the web. It allows you to:
  - Organize text into headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
  - Embed images, videos, and other multimedia.
  - Create links to navigate between pages.
  - Formulate tables and forms for data entry.
